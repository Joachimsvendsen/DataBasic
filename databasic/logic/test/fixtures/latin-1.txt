Last quarter, it was just announced, our gross domestic product - a sign of strength, right? But not for us.
It was below zero. Who ever heard of this? ItÕs never below zero.
Our labor participation rate was the worst since 1978.
But think of it, GDP below zero, horrible labor participation rate, and our real unemployment is anywhere from 18-20%. DonÕt believe the 5.6. DonÕt believe it.
ThatÕs right - a lot of people up there canÕt get jobs. They canÕt get jobs because there are no jobs because China has our jobs and Mexico has our jobs. They all have our jobs. But the real number, the real number, is anywhere from 18-19 and maybe even 21% and nobody talks about it because itÕs a statistic thatÕs full of nonsense.
Our enemies are getting stronger and stronger by the day and we as a country are getting weaker. Even our nuclear arsenal doesnÕt work.
