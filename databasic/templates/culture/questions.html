In this activity, you will work with colleagues to ask good questions of a spreadsheet so that you can take it from data points to data story. You will use Databasic.io's WTFcsv tool, get acquainted data types, and do some basic spreadsheet analysis.  <em>csv</em> stands for <em>comma separated values</em>, a common spreadsheet format on the web. <em>WTF</em> stands for... well... the question you ask when someone sends you an inscrutable csv file. You should work in groups of 2-3 colleagues to start asking better questions than <em>WTF</em>. Start the activity by playing the kickoff video below for your group.") }}</p>

For example, what information in your organization is captured in spreadsheet form? Could you use this same approach with survey result data? With financial data? With lists of donors or web analytics? How can having groups come up with questions help you take the next step with your organization's data?
