You will learn some basic terminology for quantitative text analysis, get acquainted with Databasic.io's WordCounter tool, and start to consider places in your organization where you work with text as data.  You'll pair up with your colleagues to search for stories in some fun sample data and then draw a sketch to tell the story you find to your colleagues.
