"Understanding the data in your csv file is the first step in analyzing it"
" for stories. Looking at individual columns can help you identify "
"questions that might be fun to ask about your data.  For instance, is it "
"surprising that \"%(most_common_value)s\" is the most frequent value in "
"the %(random_column_name)s column?  Does it make any sense to compare the"
" %(random_column_name2)s column to the %(random_column_name3)s column?  "
"Are there any other datasets you could find to ask interesting questions "
"about the %(random_column_name)s column?  <br /><br />Asking these types "
"of questions is the first step in understanding the data you have, and "
